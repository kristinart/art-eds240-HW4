# Description

I plan to pursue option 2 for HW #4. My research question has changed to the following:

How does potential supply and demand of green hydrogen fuel in 2030 vary across space in California? 

Within this overarching question, I will answer the following questions using my infographic components:

1)  What is the spatial distribution of potential green hydrogen supply and demand for hydrogen fuel from the transportation sector in 2030? 

2) How does potential supply and demand for hydrogen fuel compare within and between regions in 2030? Will individual regions be able to produce enough supply to meet local demand amounts?

3)  Will individual counties in Southern California be able to produce enough supply to meet local demand amounts in 2030? Which counties will be net importers or net exporters of hydrogen fuel? 

I have decided to include data from my MESM Group Project (GP) for this assignment. I have used output data from our GP that contains the following variables:

-   demand_h2_kg_d, which is the amount of hydrogen in kg per day that will be demanded at each projected demand location. These values correspond to point geometries for potential hydrogen re-fueling stations that were developed through a comprehensive study by the UC Davis Institute of Transportation Studies (Fulton et al. 2023).

-   supply_h2_kg_d, which is the amount of hydrogen in kg per day that can be produced through wind- or solar-powered electrolysis. These values correspond to point geometries that my GP team developed by identifying renewable resource potential, excluding area unsuitable for renewable development, and siting electrolyzer (hydrogen production technology) facilities through an optimization model.

I aggregated these two variables into county and regional totals for plotting purposes by spatially joining the data with county geometries from the US Census Bureau.

# Visualization Resources

Below are two visualizations I might borrow from for this assignment.

The first is a visualization created by Cedric Scherer that I found here: https://github.com/z3tt/TidyTuesday/blob/main/R/2021_27_AnimalRescues.Rmd https://github.com/Z3tt/TidyTuesday/tree/main/plots/2021_27. I like layout of this visualization and the use of annotations alongside the visuals. I also like that he colored certain words and used color on the plots to emphasize them. I may adapt from his code to figure out how to size the graphics, add annotations, etc. 

![](../figures/2021_27_animal_rescues_Cedric.png)

The second is a visualization created by Dan Oehm that I found here: https://github.com/doehm/tidytues/blob/main/scripts/2023/week-31-us-states/us-states.R. I like how he annotated with text and may borrow from his code to understand how to add and position annotations. He also used patchwork, included custom fonts, and labeled histogram bars, which I would like to do for one of my figures as well.

# Draft Infographic

Here is a rough drawing of the infographic I would like to make. The actual layout of the subplots and text will probably change based on what the components look like after being coded. ![](../figures/infographic_mockup.png)

Below are drafts of the infographic's subplots:

    The transportation sector is expected to be the earliest adopter of hydrogen fuel for use in light-, medium-, and heavy-duty fuel cell electric
  vehicles (FCEVs). In California, production of green hydrogen through electrolysis is constrained to areas with sufficient wind and solar
  resources, water availability, and favorable permitting and regulation policies. Here, we explore the spatial match-up of potential green hydrogen
  supply and transportation sector demand in 2030 to get a sense of how important hydrogen distribution and alternative production methods will be.

# Reflection

Answer the following questions:

What challenges did you encounter or anticipate encountering as you continue to build / iterate on your visualizations in R?

*I am finding it challenging to figure out what types of graphs would look alright together in the same graphic. I made some plot options to see how things might look together, but overall it feels like a lot of info to fit onto one page. I also wasted time on some more complicated plots before deciding to just stick with the simpler visualizations above. It also took a lot of time to adjust and fiddle with all of the plot components and aesthetics.*

*I expect it will be also take a lot of time to fiddle with the layout of the overall infographic. I anticipate some head-banging to get plot sizes/aspect ratios, text sizes/ layouts, white space/ margins, etc. to look alright... particularly because I don't have much experience using cowplot, patchwork, annotate, etc.*

What ggplot extension tools / packages do you need to use to build your visualizations? Are there any that we haven't covered in class that you'll be learning how to use for your visualizations?

*I will use patchwork, ggtext, ggpubr, and maybe gridExtra to build the rest of my visualization. I am also using ggpattern, which I don't believe we've covered in class yet. ggpattern has pretty good documentation though.* 

What feedback do you need from the instructional team and / or your peers to ensure that your intended message is clear?

*I would appreciate some coding tips on how to add/ adjust whitespace and plot sub-commponents. Like is it possible to overlay a plot slightly over another one using patchwork or do you have to do an inset instead? How do you make sure all the text sizes are actually readable when certain plots are smaller or bigger - is it just manual adjustment in each subplot or is there a function to help with that once subplots have been stitched together? Is it easier to set a figure size beforehand to make sure the appearance in the R plot window will be similar to the final saved product? What is the best way to save a high quality image? I also saw some good tips in the visualizations from the course resource page, so I will spend some time learning the ways there.*

*I also have not had a chance to put all the infographic components together with text narration, so any recommendations on layout are also appreciated.*
